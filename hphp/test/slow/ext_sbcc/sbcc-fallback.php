/**
 * Test: Nonexistent Eval.SBCCPath → graceful fallback.
 *
 * Eval.SBCCPath points to a file that doesn't exist. HHVM should not crash
 * and init_errors should be incremented.
 *
 * This test uses .opts to set Eval.SBCCPath directly (rather than .sbcc_fixture)
 * because the scenario under test is specifically a missing file path — there
 * is no artifact to materialize, and the runner should not attempt to build one.
